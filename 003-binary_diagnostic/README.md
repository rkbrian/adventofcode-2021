# Binary diagnostic
 - Given a series of binary data to find the power consumption and life support rating of the creaky submarine
 - Find the gamma rate "g" and epsilon rate "e" and calculate the power consumption int(g * e)
 -- g in binary is the most common digit rep
 -- e in binary is the least common digit rep
 - Find the oxygen rate "o" and CO2 rate "c" and calculate the life support rating int(o * c)
 -- o in binary is the array with all the most common digits
 -- c in binary is the array with all the least common digits

### part 1: power consumption (g * e)

### part 2: life support rating (o * c)
